## GoldSource Engine Clone Prototype 🎮

A clean, open-source reimplementation of the GoldSource game engine,  
built entirely from the original Quake (id Tech 2) engine sources.

## Extended Q&A ❓

### Q: What is this project? 🤔  
**A:** This is a reimplementation of the [GoldSource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoldSrc) game engine that relies solely on the original id Tech 2 (NetQuake/QuakeWorld/Quake II) source code and its forks. We deliberately avoid using any reverse-engineered code from projects like ReHLDS or Xash3D.

---

### Q: How different is GoldSource from the original Quake engine? 🔍  
**A:** The differences are mostly technical. GoldSource evolved from Quake, but it introduces its own updates and modifications that give it a distinct character while preserving the core architecture.

---

### Q: Which operating systems are supported? 💻  
**A:** The engine is primarily tested on Windows. Mac support has not work yet, so contributions in that area are welcome.

---

### Q: Will the engine support newer rendering APIs like Vulkan or DirectX 11+? 🎨  
**A:** There are no immediate plans for major API overhauls. The focus remains on preserving the classic id Tech 2/GoldSource style. However, community-driven pull requests for modern features are encouraged as long as they adhere to GPL compliance.

---

### Q: How can I contribute? 🤝  
**A:** Contributions are highly welcome! You can help by submitting pull requests, reporting issues, or suggesting new features. Please review the project's contribution guidelines on GitHub before getting started.

---

### Q: Is there any official documentation on how to build this engine? 📚  
**A:** Detailed build instructions and documentation are in the works. I plan to add a `/Docs` directory soon with comprehensive guides on compiling and using the engine. Stay tuned for updates!

---

### Q: I have more questions or want to discuss ideas. Where can I go? 💬  
**A:** Please check out the project’s GitHub Issues and Discussions sections, or join any community channels linked in the repository. We encourage open conversation and are here to help with any questions or suggestions.
